# KymatioWrapper
A simple wrapper to be able to call Kymatio commands via julia. Make sure 
your PyCall isn't using the system-wide python, so that you can actually run 
pip. If the build isn't working on it's own, you may want to run the 
necessary commands on the command line. In the following, substitute root 
for the path to your conda environment (the value of `Conda.ROOTENV`):
```
> root/bin/conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
> root/bin/pip install kymatio
```

# 1D Example
```
	J=6; Q=16; T = 2^13
	x = zeros(T, 5, 3);
	t = (range(0,2π,length=T));
	for (ii, ω)=enumerate(floor.(Int, range(1,150,length=5))), jj=1:3
		x[:,ii,jj] = sin.(ω/jj .* t) + cos.(100*ω/jj .* t.^2)
	end
	s = Scattering(T, Q=16)
	sx = s(x)
	meta = compute_meta_scattering(s)
	sx[:, meta.order .==1,1,1]
